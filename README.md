# AI for Predictive Environmental Disaster Management


This project uses AI-based logic and real-time environmental sensor data to predict possible natural disasters. It simulates data like temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and air quality, then applies intelligent rules to predict disasters such as heatwaves, floods, storms, wildfires, etc.
